Step-by-Step Outline: AI Agents + Ethereum Smart Contracts
1)Set Up the Project Environment
- Create a GitHub repository and initialize the project.
- Install required dependencies (langchain, openai, web3, fastapi, hardhat).
- Set up a virtual environment and configure .env for API keys.

2) Set Up Ethereum Testnet (Infura + Wallet)
- Create an Infura account and get a Sepolia testnet RPC URL.
- Set up MetaMask wallet, switch to Sepolia testnet, and get test ETH.
- Verify blockchain connection using Web3.py.

3) Build the AI Agent (LangChain + OpenAI)
- Implement an AI function to fetch financial data (ETH price from Binance API).
- Process market conditions and decide when to execute transactions.
- Test AI agent response and logic.

4) Deploy a Smart Contract on Ethereum Testnet
- Write a Solidity contract (Escrow for ETH trades).
- Compile the contract using Hardhat.
- Deploy the contract to Sepolia testnet and get the contract address.

5) Connect AI Agent to Smart Contract (Web3.py / Web3.js)
- Write a Python script to interact with the deployed contract.
- AI agent calls the smart contract when conditions are met (e.g., ETH < $3000).
- Test the transaction flow and debug any issues.

6) Build a Backend API (FastAPI / Express.js)
- Create a REST API that allows external services to interact with the AI agent.
- Implement endpoints for checking ETH price, executing trades, and viewing transactions.

7) Testing & Optimization
- Simulate different market conditions and verify AI decision-making.
- Ensure smart contract executes transactions correctly.
- Optimize API performance and security.

8) Document & Push to GitHub
- Maintain Jupyter Notebook documentation for AI logic and blockchain execution.
- Push the full project to GitHub with a clear README.md.
